# Steganography
@Unisociesc 2016 - Esteganografia, Fundamentos de Seguran√ßa

This was made to Encrypt and Decrypt archives inside images, in a way to make the change at the main image imperceptible. It also have different ways to encrypt so you'll only be able to decrypt if you do it the same way you encrypted.

Things to Upgrade:
  * Not only limit to RGB but add the Alpha also.
  * Change in a way that you can choose less or more levels of encryption making it possible to only encrypt with 1 or more e.g: only blue, or blue and red, or any other possible variation. this way the number of possiblities go from 6 to 64 (with alpha).
  * Correcting the jpg, jpeg when encrypting.
  

This project was made for the class of Security Fundamentals from bachelor of computer engineer.
